This is an attempt at creating some utilities for reading and writing OWL models. 

Goal is to (eventually) support:

- reading an OWL file and providing a map back of the data
- providing useful query API into an OWL model
- writing an OWL model based off a map of data
- support all OWL syntaxes; code should work across all without user needing
to specify syntax.

NOTE: this is my first clojure code (EVER), so comments about everything (e.g style, algorithms, use of functions) are appreciated.
